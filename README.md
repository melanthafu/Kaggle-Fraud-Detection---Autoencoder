# Kaggle-Fraud-Detection-Autoencoder


"Autoencoding" is a data compression algorithm where the compression and decompression functions are 
  1) data-specific 
  2) lossy
  3) learned automatically from examples rather than engineered by a human. Additionally, in almost all contexts where the term      "autoencoder" is used, the compression and decompression functions are implemented with neural networks.
